Hello, if you are reading this because of a class assignemnt i want you to know

Today is a special assignment, i put everything in one doc so you can feel and find it easier to mark and satisfactory. I hope you and your kids (if you have any) are doing well, make sure you value your mental health and general health.

At this time this was made, over half my family was sick, and afterall its winter. So, stay safe!

My main reason for programming and entirely my motivation is solely as a way to vent and cry out how i feel, to others, i appear cold and straight faced, but at home? Its a different story, when you're told youre learning pointless information or being told to try harder, it really is demotivating, but just like my other hobbies like Video editing, making music, drawing, its all to silently take out how negative i may feel, so even though you dont see someones suffering, it doesnt mean they aren't. So take the chance to ask, hug them, or comfort that person. It may change their life.
